![TechPost Blog: Custom Child Theme, Redesign](https://d3sezit9y3vl9o.cloudfront.net/thepg/screens/tp.gif)

**Lessons Learned**: When contemplating a redesign, businesses often look first to the theme store. For an existing brand, one-size-fits-all solutions are difficult to tame and often lack support for older browsers. I proposed building a custom theme, and while offered a good learning experience, I soon realized I was reinventing the wheel for a rather conventional blog, and it would make more sense to build a child theme for this project. WordPress's out-of-the-box themes are responsive by default, have great browser support, and no feature bloat. I built a child theme atop of twentysixteen, making use of a lot of the base templates so I could spend more time crafting a fresh, modern look that would attract renewed interest in the content.
